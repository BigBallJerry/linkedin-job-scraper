Located in Oslo, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Copenhagen and Karlstad with a mission to share knowledge and best practices for a more open society. We're passionate about open solutions, open business models and an open society where we work together for maximum benefit to everyone. We've got some really skilled co-workers here at Redpill Linpro, particular within our main areas which is API management, microservices, IT operations, cloud, DevOps and automation. Welcome to Redpill Linpro, the leading provider of Open Source services and products in the Nordic countries. Our business concept is to offer services that accelerate and help spread open-source software. We are an open-minded and humble company with a strong focus on knowledge sharing. We are passionate about available solutions, open business models and an open society where we work together for maximum benefit to everyone. What is this position about and why would you want it?! You would be joining the nascent Data & Analytics team within Redpill Linpro, where we together will build up a fun, challenging and rewarding team of data professionals! Working as a data engineering consultant based in a D&A team, that in turn is part of a greater team of other technical consultants within Redpill Linpro – will provide an excellent combination of continuous personal development, good salary and varying projects! What specifically we will work on, will of course depend on ongoing projects, but generally the vision has a couple of overarching components: -Technology: Google Cloud platform through Bigquery, Looker & Data Studio, BQML, Vertex AI and more, is going to be our main focus. Not limited to of course, since our clients will likely have a plethora of different tech stacks, and as a data professional we love to learn! -Utilizing the latest trends such as analytical engineering & ingestion platforms. -Learning: A typical treat of a true data professional is the need to keep developing, trying new things. Being coached, coaching others and supporting each others’ projects will be a core aspect of the team. -For the clients: Typically it costs a company more to have consultants compared to employees, however this will not be the case for us. We will be a team of experts that through experience, skills, using the right tools for the job and helping each other – will deliver serious value-for-money. -Teamwork: We will take inspiration from other consulting industries such as management consulting, and utilize the synergies found in combining seniors with juniors in projects. For more leverage on the seniors’ experience and higher efficiency/learning for the juniors A data engineer typically needs to have a strong technical understanding of our tools, build pipelines, design data models, understand business logic and much more that you are familiar with. Acting as a consultant also adds an additional dimension where communication & collaboration skills are highly valuable. This is an opportunity for you to: -As a consultant you will be allowed to really focus on the project at hand. -As a consultant you will see more companies, projects, data environments – which can be challenging but also developing! -Work with other D&A ambitious colleagues who likes to learn and move fast. -Be part of a larger group of technical consultants. -Be able to boost your salary through your performance. Experience & training we believe that you have: -You have a strong and relevant academic background that supports you in your work. Such as computer science, engineering, Mathematics, informatics or a related degree. -You have worked on cloud data warehouses before, and preferably have been designing environments and data models in these as well. -You have at least some experience in developing Business Intelligence, dashboards, reports as well. -Even if doing analysis may not be your forte, you are at a minimum skilled at supporting the business in delivering it, and understanding the business requirements around it. You have at least 3 years of experience working as a data professional, with at least 1 of those in a data engineering role and with cloud based solutions. -Orchestration, joins, data types, computational efforts, (de)normalized data, APIs, nested tables - are concepts that you are adept in. -We are looking for both senior and junior team members – being able to have a mix of junior and senior team members is a recipe for success! View on the technical skills needed: -Cloud datawarehouses: Bigquery primarily, but redshift and azure are a plus as well. -On-premise datawarehouses: Not our focus, but very useful to be able to manage and develop non-cloud datawarehouses such as mysql/mariadb/mongodb, since many companies are either already invested in these, require on-premise or otherwise at least have data sourced from them. -Orchestration: A good orchestration design is key to a good data model. If you are used to Airflow, dbt, and dataform are all good. The greatest strength lies in understanding the orchestration steps and the process around it. -BI tools: Looker & Data studio are likely our main bets – but clients will often have other existing installations, so wide experience in being able to develop in different BI tools, is good. -Version control: You are comfortable with GIT version control and understand why it is so useful. -Languages: The more the better as a consultant, but you are an expert in SQL and quite advanced in Python at least.

Output kan sedan användas för analys eller som input-data till en algoritm. Datakvalitet ser du som något väsentligt och något du säkerställer i ditt sätt att arbeta.  Hos oss kommer du finna variation i ditt arbete, du kan i ena uppdraget skapa applikationer som förkortar vårdköer till att förutspå när en lastbil behöver service. För HiQ jobbar med många spännande kunder i de flesta branscher, allt från fordon- och flygindustrin till e-hälsa och retail.    För att matcha med våra uppdrag på bästa sätt, ska du helst vara utbildad civilingenjör i datavetenskap eller likvärdigt. HiQ är ett kulturdrivet företag där våra ledord; resultat, ansvar, enkelhet och glädje driver oss framåt. Det är anledningen att vi fokuserar mycket på vem du är. Tyvärr kan vi inte bara anställa dig på grund av din härliga personlighet, vi ser gärna att du har arbetat i minst 2 år som Data Engineer eller liknande och har arbetat med något av de följande:   Vi matchar ännu bättre om du också har erfarenhet av:   Vi tror du är nyfiken på att testa nya sätt att skapa de bästa lösningarna för olika behov och du säker ständigt ny kunskap för att hålla dig uppdaterad inom området. Du gillar att lösa problem i en snabbt växande miljö och uppskattar en arbetsplats som drivs av lagarbete, kreativitet, nyfikenhet och glädje.    Att vara HiQare är både utmanande och omväxlande. Vi är alla konsulter vilket innebär att vi i våra projekt hos kund eller in-house får prova nytt och bli exponerad för nya branscher, arbetsplatser och tech-stacks. Variationen är stor och utvecklingstakten snabb. Hos oss får du bidra och bemästra dina starkaste kompetenser, men även utforska och utveckla nya. Med rätt attityd och kompetens bidrar du med värde både i ditt uppdrag och till dina kollegor på HiQ.  Tillsammans består vi idag av över 1500 HiQare i fem länder. Hos oss hittar du allt från marknadens vassaste utvecklare, testare och hackers, till projektledare, agila coacher och designers. Även om våra kompetenser är många och olika så har vi mycket gemensamt – vi tycker om att driva utveckling, att förbättra och förenkla... och framför allt – att ha kul på vägen!  Vi sätter stor tilltro att du vill vara med och skapa bolaget som vi jobbar på. Detta tror vi att du bland annat gör genom att dela med dig av din kompetens (vare sig det handlar om de senaste ramverken eller i detalj hur en push & pull-rörförstärkare med KT88-rör funkar) och genom att ta dig an uppdrag med ett öppet sinne, nyfikenhet och driv. Vi tror att du trivs i en enkel organisation där korta beslutsvägar och en närvarande chef är viktigt för dig.  Utöver stor variation i uppdragstyper, härliga kollegor, någorlunda disciplin i Teams-möten kan vi också erbjuda en väldigt spännande resa in i ett nytt HiQ – där vi har ställt in siktet på att bygga norra Europas ledande tech-konsultbolag.  HiQ är kulturdrivet, inte regelstyrt, och det gör att man kan vara sig själv till 100%. En följd av det är att man som HiQ:are tar sitt jobb seriöst, men inte alltid sig själva :) Det som genomsyrar oss all är viljan och ambitionen att bidra till att göra världen lite bättre med hjälp av teknik och kommunikationslösningar som förenklar människors liv. På riktigt."

As we want to bring transparency, trust, and clarity to the music industry we serve, we know a change comes from within. Utopia is a transparent, trust-based organization striving to have clarity in thinking and doing what we set out to do.  We execute urgently and innovate to grow faster.

Vi är alla konsulter vilket innebär att vi i våra projekt hos kund eller in-house får prova nytt och bli exponerad för nya branscher, arbetsplatser och tech-stacks. Variationen är stor och utvecklingstakten snabb. Hos oss får du bidra och bemästra dina starkaste kompetenser, men även utforska och utveckla nya. Med rätt attityd och kompetens bidrar du med värde både i ditt uppdrag och till dina kollegor på HiQ.  Tillsammans består vi idag av över 1500 HiQare i fem länder. Hos oss hittar du allt från marknadens vassaste utvecklare, testare och hackers, till projektledare, agila coacher och designers. Även om våra kompetenser är många och olika så har vi mycket gemensamt – vi tycker om att driva utveckling, att förbättra och förenkla... och framför allt – att ha kul på vägen!  Vi sätter stor tilltro att du vill vara med och skapa bolaget som vi jobbar på. Detta tror vi att du bland annat gör genom att dela med dig av din kompetens (vare sig det handlar om de senaste ramverken eller i detalj hur en push & pull-rörförstärkare med KT88-rör funkar) och genom att ta dig an uppdrag med ett öppet sinne, nyfikenhet och driv. Vi tror att du trivs i en enkel organisation där korta beslutsvägar och en närvarande chef är viktigt för dig.  Utöver stor variation i uppdragstyper, härliga kollegor, någorlunda disciplin i Teams-möten kan vi också erbjuda en väldigt spännande resa in i ett nytt HiQ – där vi har ställt in siktet på att bygga norra Europas ledande tech-konsultbolag.  HiQ är kulturdrivet, inte regelstyrt, och det gör att man kan vara sig själv till 100%. En följd avdet är att man som HiQ:are tar sitt jobb seriöst, men inte alltid sig själva :) Det som genomsyrar oss all är viljan och ambitionen att bidra till att göra världen lite bättre med hjälp av teknik och kommunikationslösningar som förenklar människors liv. På riktigt.  I och med att sommaren äntligen är här så är många av oss är på semester. Det kan därför dröja till mitten av augusti innan du får återkoppling på din ansökan.

Nu har du chansen att bli en del av oss, läs mer och ansök nedan.    I din roll som ML Engineer kommer du arbeta i nära samarbete med våra Data Scientists för att bland annat utveckla arbetsflöden och pipelines i Kubernetes/Kubeflow.

Det är också därför du kommer märka att vårt spelansvarsarbete genomsyrar hela företaget från första dagen du börjar jobba hos oss.

Learn more We are searching for a competitive Solutions Engineer to join our exceptional team at Normative in 111 44 Stockholm.  Growing your career as a Full Time Solutions Engineer is a great opportunity to develop productive skills.  If you are strong in cooperation, planning and have the right initiative for the job, then apply for the position of Solutions Engineer at Normative today!    Any company would say its employees are smart, capable, and fun to work with – and our employees certainly are! But we’re also driven by an unshakable sense of purpose, an urgency to act, and the motivation to devote our talents and energy to fighting the planet’s most important fight.  At Normative we are creating the norm for carbon accounting by providing intelligence to companies to reduce their climate footprint. We translate financial data into tangible carbon insights enabling companies to understand and reduce their carbon emission. What we do has a real positive impact on the climate. You can too!    As our first dedicated Solutions Engineer, you will be the technical expert who owns integrations and data exchange workflows between customers, partners and Normative so that they can smoothly calculate their carbon footprint.  You will be working closely with technical counterparts outside of Normative (from pre-sales discussions to the implementation of data upload processes), our Sales, Product and Engineering teams and other functions within Normative. Together with our customers and partners, you will be mapping out complex setups of ERP, accounting and procurement systems like SAP, Navision or Netsuite and figuring out how to best connect two worlds that don’t always want to fit together.  As we are building out our offering of APIs, data connectors and other connectivity options you will be working closely with our Product teams to share learnings, customer and industry insights, participate in workshops and test and roll out new solutions to our customers and partners.  Your performance will have a direct impact on both the effectiveness of our sales team and the direction and scalability of our product. And as our first dedicated colleague working in this space, you will be able to significantly shape our industry’s integration landscape and the Solutions Engineering function at Normative. Our shared goal is to create first in class data connectivity options which allow our customers to spend as little time as possible on data handling and instead focus on what really matters: moving towards net zero emissions.  The Solutions Engineer we are looking for enjoys and thrives in scale-up tech companies and is excited about being part of building and utilizing this kind of infrastructure for our customers and partners - and ultimately our planet.        At Normative you will work in a modern and fast paced environment with highly driven and achieving people with a common vision to make a change for a sustainable future. We trust that you do your job in time and with excellence. At Normative you’ll have opportunities for professional development and competitive benefits.    Normative operates on a hybrid remote model (based on time zone) with offices in Stockholm, Copenhagen and London. For this role you can be based either in one of our office hubs or work remotely. If you want to relocate, we offer this only for Sweden at the moment, including relocation support and information will be provided during our recruitment process.  To be hired remotely, you’ll need to be located in a country 2 hours +/- to the Central European Time Zone. If you want to join our mission from other countries, we are able to offer employment where remote.com are able to employ, meaning you will be hired through local labor laws but enrolled as a fully permanent employee.  We will offer you a home office set up and you will be requested to travel to one of our hubs to meet your team/the company approximately 4 times per year ( depending on role).  To ensure we walk the talk we use trains for up to 6 hours of travel and flights for longer travels.    We adopt a continuous selection process, so make sure to apply with your CV as soon as possible! Normative handles sensitive financial data and we will therefore conduct a background check before signing any candidate.  We welcome diversity with open arms and want to see candidates from different backgrounds and experiences."

We're a company that deals with company spending: we think that all employees should be trusted to spend company money.  It's an exciting time for us: we raised over $350M in our latest investment Series C round, and Pleo is launching in 15 new markets this year (we currently have offices in Copenhagen, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid and Lisbon).    Here in the Revenue Operations team, we set our people & partners up for success in order to deliver great distribution experience across the customer lifecycle, which results in unlocking true growth potential & improving customer lifetime value. We do this by supporting all operational, enablement & strategic activities across the customer lifecycle.  As a Deal Desk Specialist, you will work cross-functionally within Rev.Ops, but also Billing, Contracts and Legal teams to provide quoting and deal structuring support to the Sales teams. This will be a growth position as Pleo’s business continues to massively expand.

Why work here?  Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Through fintech we've seen a way to impact how people work; we think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. Based on some pretty amazing Series C-round investment in 2021 we think we're onto something big.  So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 800+ team, from over 74 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal, or Lisbon offices – and quite a few full-time remotes in 35 other countries!

To learn more about this opportunity, reach out to George Paxton on LinkedIn who is responsible for this advert. You can also reach him at g.paxton@jeffersonfrank.com.    Jefferson Frank are delighted to be working with a software-based start-up based in Stockholm that have development & their respective IT teams at the very core of their business mission. A common frustration for developers in this current market place is that software development departments are a complimentary, add-on aspect to an organisations core product/service which they deliver to customers. This results in developers feeling disillusional and that their work isn't as valued as it could be. This client takes the opposite approach, their development team is at the very centre of their product lines designed to search for a specific need to their customers.  This client was born out of the frustration with complex & inflexible hardware-driven software solutions not delivering according to application needs nor to brand promises. In the earlier days a key observation made was that existing software solutions didn't support the rapidly changing requirements of managing, processing and storing data whilst still supporting application development requirements. They have an ambitious long-term goal to become the leader in data access software building multi-cloud solutions.  They operate with 2 product lines which are build in-house that 1) Orchestrate and govern data in a secure, cloud native format and 2) transform object storage into a shared file system. What's unique about this market-disruptive software is that it provides a close-to-application abstraction layer that allows customers to get greater value from their data. When it comes to building solutions they take a simplistic approach to achieve high quality and uncomplicated design. Building their software completely from scratch, this sit's between the customers application layers with hybrid cloud configurations. This patented approach improves performance, adds redundancy of data whilst securing and protecting their data.    They're hiring for DevOps Engineers to join their growing integrations and infrastructure deployment team. You'll be joining a largely senior team who have helped to develop the product to what it consists of today. Working with a complex product that encompasses a deployment module and customer portal with supporting CLI & web interfaces there will be a high degree of variation with the tasks. Truly, no 2 days will be the same in this position. This also means that your technical competence will be tested daily, working on complex challenges requiring you to think in different ways and taking a holistic view to the software architecture.  Within this product team you'll be under the supervision of a tech lead that reports to the CTO. You'll be working on a customer facing application that enables multi-cloud integration's with protections for cloud data alongside enabling programmatic data management policies. Your day-to-day will be focused on developing their software deployment and customer integration options alongside supporting customers in defining bespoke approaches when necessary. This is a customer facing role so experience in customer environments/working extensively with customer facing applications is required.  You'll bring a wealth of experience working with DevOps, ideally in cloud/hybrid cloud environments deploying large-scale & complex solutions. A fundamental for this position is is your experience with container orchestration as there is a significant degree of work to be completed with integration's. As a sufficient proportion of this position involves greenfield development you'll bring strong knowledge working with infrastructure architecture and cloud services for object storage. Any of the popular public providers is sufficient alongside being well-versed with deployment of distribution solutions.      In return, you will joining a growing and innovative start-up that takes a technology-first approach to their business model where you will truly be at the clients core with the ability to influence key decisions which are made. You'll be working with a modern tech stack (infrastructure is built with Golang).  To apply for this position, send your CV via this portal or email it to g.paxton@jeffersonfrank.com.

Who We Are  Columbia Road builds seamless and commercially effective customer journeys that create impact. We help our clients get more revenue and more customers, but also to sell better. Our tight-knit team consists of business consultants who understand software and of highly talented business-driven design and technology specialists.  Currently, we have over 20 nationalities working in the company and the official language is English. Our company spirit is one of a true start-up, but with a twist of hard-core experience. We believe in giving a lot of responsibility and freedom to our employees. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are at the heart of our essence and everyone at Columbia Road is committed to these values.  Columbia Road has grown from 0 to over 140 exceptionally talented people in 6 years and in two countries. We are proud of the high customer satisfaction we have achieved as a result of focusing on people and creating concrete, measurable business impact for our clients every day.  Take a look at our Culture Code & People to get to know us better. We come 100% recommended on Glassdoor with a 4.8/5 score.  Columbia Road is a part of the Futurice family of companies.    As a consultant at Columbia Road, you will be working in the core of our clients’ businesses; advising, designing and implementing the tech needed to drive the business forward. You build businesses with code. You build storefronts, APIs and the integrations needed to glue them together. Your focus is likely on some part of the stack, be it frontend, backend or something like complex integrations but you aren’t too afraid to get your hands dirty with the other areas when necessary. You are comfortable working with a variety of programming languages and technology stacks - or at least you are interested to jump in and learn new skills. Columbia Road is not trying to provide the same solution to everyone, and sometimes that requires quite a bit of adapting from our side.  The focus on digital sales still means that we are tackling a large variety of projects. These range from ecommerce platforms and data platform projects to site optimisation and mobile development. For a few concrete examples of our tech cases, take a look at the Servaali case of a new microservice business-to-business shop, the full webstore renewal project for Oura, and our work for Matsmart in the optimisation of an existing store.  All of our consultants work directly with client stakeholders to build a good understanding of their business and its challenges. While development is probably where most of your time goes, we are in the business of creating impact for our clients, and that means spending some time to understand how the business functions. We help our clients in translating business opportunities into actionable plans and concrete solutions. Read more about how we code and design high performing digital sales channels.  We work as diverse teams of digital sales experts, tailored to each project. In some projects, this means working as part of a larger development team, while sometimes the setup needed is a growth team. As we believe that best results arise from employee freedom, all teams have wide latitude to choose the best tools and ways of working for themselves. This also means that your technology stack and specific role may vary between projects. We see this as a great opportunity for professional growth and are looking for colleagues who also value this. The more experience you have, the more you'll be able to take responsibility for your client projects and help other Roadies grow as well.  We pay extra attention to professional growth and learning at Columbia Road. We encourage you to follow your own points of interest, and we do this proactively. Together we'll continuously think about the best career advancement possibilities for you, both during and in between your client projects. Our internal learning opportunities come in many forms: events, courses, certifications, and afterworks, for example.       The recruitment process usually has 1-3 steps during which we get to know who you are and what motivates you. You will learn more about Columbia Road and get to meet different people from our company. You'll have the opportunity to present highlights from your career and tell us about your skills, roles, and learnings.  We’re committed to creating a good match between you and our organisation, and want to spend time to get it right. Sometimes, an assignment might be given to you to complete between interviews.  When we’re done with the face-to-face discussions, we’ll contact the people you have chosen as references.  We hope to hear from you soon!     : We are currently not able to hire outside of Sweden, so you need to already live in Sweden to apply."

3139523894,Cloud Engineer to accelerate our growing cloud journey,Solita,https://www.linkedin.com/company/solita/life/,,2 months ago,14,Full-time,,,,,,"About the job Are you ignited by cloud computing and would like to build on your skills amongst a team of fellow cloud enthusiasts? Does time fly when you get to work on and resolve complex business challenges in a dynamic yet supportive environment? Then read on, we are now looking for Cloud Engineers to join our growing team!  As a Cloud Engineer at Solita Sweden, you would form part of a community of 40+ Cloud & Connectivity experts supported by a leading network of over 1500 Solitans supporting customers’ digital transformation journey across 6 countries in Northern Europe. By joining Solita, one of the top companies in cloud services in the Nordics with solid experience in designing and implementing cloud solutions in the public and private sector, you will have the chance to work closely with our partners; AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. As a tech agnostic firm, you’ll have the opportunity to affect the technologies and methodologies we use in our projects. We want to give you the freedom to shape your future role and competence, and also the tools you may need along the way.      Mauro was one of our talented Cloud Academy students back in autumn 2021 where he was introduced to the top public cloud providers and their services. Following 4 certifications in GCP, AWS and Azure, Mauro’s curiosity for cloud infrastructure was awakened and his career at Solita quickly took off. In just a few months, he has had the chance to work on two very different projects; in the first project, his work consisted of app and integration development for a customer’s property management platform – the integrations were run in Azure, and the project has now reached the test phase.  Currently, Mauro is in a project for a major customer, alongside a team of 8 fellow Solitans, wherein he contributes to making master data user friendly through a combination of cloud engineering and API development. His work comprises Azure set-ups, IaC, release pipelines and DevOps. Mauro feels he has already been able to leverage a variety of skills by both working in a smaller scale project wherein he was involved in all stages from design to set-up and with closer contact to the customer and end user, to working in a larger scale project with clearly defined responsibilities within the team, in a more complex environment.  Mauro has thoroughly enjoyed being given the possibility to choose the path that is of interest to him. The projects that he has been assigned have involved increasingly more cloud infrastructure, which is where his passion lies and where he would like to steer his career.      Our head offices are in Stockholm and Gothenburg, and we also have smaller offices / talent hubs in Malmö, Östersund and Skellefteå. However, we are open to staying flexible to your needs and preferences and also embrace remote work. The role may include occasional travel to the customer site.    We would love to hear from you! Tell us about your skills and desires and we can figure out together if we could be a match. Send your free-form application for our review.  For more information, please contact Head of People & Culture Peter Svensson ([email protected]) or Senior Consultant & People Lead Patrik Rafstedt ([email protected]).    Unfortunately, currently we can’t offer relocation for candidates outside Sweden."
